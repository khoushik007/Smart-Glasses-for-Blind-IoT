# 👓 Smart Glasses for the Blind

## 📘 Overview
Smart Glasses for the Blind is a hardware-based IoT project designed to assist visually impaired individuals in navigating their surroundings. Using **ultrasonic sensors**, **buzzers**, and a **NE555 timer circuit**, the system detects nearby obstacles and alerts the user through sound signals.

## 🛠️ Hardware Components
- Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)
- NE555 Timer IC
- Capacitors & Resistors
- Buzzer
- Connecting Wires
- Power Supply
